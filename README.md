# Service Request Platform

## Overview

This platform facilitates the process of requesting services and receiving bids from providers. Clients can post service requests, and providers can submit bids to offer their services. This README provides an overview of the workflow involved in creating and managing service requests, bids, and responses.

## Workflow

1. **Client Creates Service Request**:
    - Clients navigate to the platform and create a new service request, providing details such as service type, location, budget, and requirements.

2. **Providers Review Service Requests**:
    - Service providers browse available service requests and review the details to determine if they match their expertise and availability.

3. **Providers Submit Bids**:
    - Interested providers submit bids for specific service requests, including details such as price, timeline, and relevant experience.

4. **Client Reviews Bids**:
    - Clients receive bids from providers interested in fulfilling their service requests.
    - They carefully review each bid, considering factors such as price, provider reputation, and proposed timeline.

5. **Client Selects Bid(s)**:
    - Based on their evaluation, clients select one or more bids that best meet their needs.
    - They may negotiate with providers to finalize terms before making their selection.

6. **Providers Confirm Commitment**:
    - Chosen providers receive notification of bid acceptance and confirm their commitment to the service request by sending a formal response.

7. **Service Fulfillment**:
    - Providers proceed to fulfill the service request according to the agreed-upon terms and timeline.
    - Clients may monitor progress and communicate with providers as needed during service delivery.
